# The Challenge
The challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

# Where to find everything
- You will find all the required assets in the /images folder. The assets are already optimized.
- There is also a style-guide.md file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
